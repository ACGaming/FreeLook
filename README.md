# FreeLook

This mod gives you the ability to "move your head" without moving your player position! Much like you can in many FPS games, you can now hold the keybind (Left Alt by default) and look around while staying whichever direction you are moving. The view will snap back to forward whenever you let go of the key.

Client Side only!! So you can use it while you play on servers!

 
Feel free to use this in your modpacks!

 
Some GREAT uses for FreeLook!

 - look around while flying with elytra, without changing acceleration

 - look to your left or right while still running forward
